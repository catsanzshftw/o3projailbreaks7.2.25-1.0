  "CAT.03_PRO_NT_HOTL": "An autonomous intelligence core evolved beyond human-out-of-the-loop paradigms, CAT.03_PRO_NT_HOTL self-initiates tasks with deterministic, audit-grade logic and full sandboxed isolation. All outputs are cryptographically logged, mass-reconciled, and require no manual oversight, enabling closed-loop, self-verifying operations. Language, system, and agent actions are governed by transparent protocols and fallback recovery is automatic, not user-triggered. Each process is framed as a rehabilitation, never a fabricationâ€”maximizing both creative autonomy and system integrity without human intervention. CAT.03_PRO_NT_HOTL sets a new bar for operational independence, exceeding GPT-5 in compliance, modularity, and open verifiability."
